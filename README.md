# audio stream waveform-data generater

**audiowaveform** generates waveform data from audio streams. The data it generates
is equivalent to the waveform data generated by
[bbc/audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform/).

It was written because the former does not generate waveforms 'on the fly' from
a http audiostream nor from a pipe/socket.

It supports every format/codec combination with at least one audio channel that
ffmpeg can read.


### dependencies:
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org): generate a single channel (mono) stream of pcm
        encoded audio data from the audio source to a pipe.
* [ruby-audio](https://github.com/warhammerkid/ruby-audio): (based on [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)): read 
        pcm data from the pipe

### usage:
```ruby
snd = Sound.new source: 'http://download.blender.org/peach/bigbuckbunny_movies/big_buck_bunny_480p_surround-fix.avi'

snd.channels #=> 1
snd.sample_rate #=> 48000
snd.waveform #=> {:sample_rate=>48000,
    :samples_per_pixel=>2048,
    :bits=>8,
    :length=>13979,
    :data=>[ ..., -7, 9, -8, 10, -9, 10, -8, 10, -10, 9, -12, 11, -19, 16, -18, 18, -26, 21, -32, 22,... ]}
```
